# Recipe API Project

This is a backend-only project built as part of the Udemy course:
ðŸ‘‰ [Build a Backend REST API with Python & Django - Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-python-advanced/learn/lecture/32236982?start=555#overview)

## About the Course

This course is a bestseller on Udemy and teaches how to build a fully functional backend REST API using Django and Django REST Framework. It emphasizes Test-Driven Development (TDD), best practices, Docker, and CI tools.

**Course highlights include:**
- Setting up a local dev environment with Docker
- Writing Python code using TDD
- Building advanced REST APIs with image upload support
- Creating reusable backend systems
- Using Travis CI for automated code checks

I purchased the course on May 31, 2025, and have been using it to level up my Django backend skills. Itâ€™s one of the best courses Iâ€™ve taken on REST API development with Django.

## About This Project

This repository contains my version of the Recipe API developed throughout the course. Itâ€™s a practice project where I applied what I learned in each section. The API allows you to:

- Authenticate users and manage tokens
- Create, update, and delete recipes
- Upload images for recipes
- Tag and categorize ingredients
- Filter recipes by tags or ingredients
- Use a fully Dockerized setup for consistent development

## Tech Stack

- Django & Django REST Framework
- Python
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL
- Travis CI
- flake8 (for linting)
- GitHub Actions (optional extension)

## Running Locally

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AsHkAn-Django/recipe-api.git
cd recipe-api
docker-compose up
```

After setup, use the `/api/` endpoints to interact with the application.

## Why I Built This

This is not a personal project, but a practice implementation of a guided course. The idea was to learn professional backend development using Django REST Framework, with a focus on testing and deployment tools. Every feature in this project was added by following along with the instructor and customizing parts along the way.

## About Me

Iâ€™m Ashkan â€” currently learning Django and backend development, and working on real-world-style projects to improve my skills. This project helped me understand REST APIs, TDD, and backend architecture.
